**Tiny, but furious IPC/RPC library ⚡️**

⚠️ THIS LIBRARY IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE **DON'T USE IT IN PRODUCTION** ⚠️

* Consistently fast and low-latency IPC using shared memory (by [shmem-ipc](https://github.com/diwic/shmem-ipc))
* Implicit connection coordination using domain sockets (by [uds](https://github.com/tormol/uds))
